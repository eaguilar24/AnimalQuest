I dance with shadows, not seen but heard, my world is silent, yet I navigate by word. Who am I?-bat-insects-fruit-nectar-fruits
Armor of scales, I wait in underwater patience, for an unsuspecting feast's entrance. Who am I?-alligator-meat-fish-insects
Cloaked in night's own shadow, I move with stealth, my howl a song for the cold midnight moon. Who am I?-wolf-meat-fish-fruit-fruits
When the days grow short and the nights long, I vanish into cold silence, a dormant song. Who am I?-bear-fish-meat-berries-salmon
Silent in the night, with eyes so bright, wisdom's symbol in the moonlight. Who am I?-owl-fish-meat-insects-mice
